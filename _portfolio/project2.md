At the very first, I regarded my behavior of pursuing almost every details of my Powerpoint slides to be perfect is a show of Obsessive-compulsive disorder, but gradually did I realize that I do enjoy the process of design and polish the presence of my work related to data, reports or papers. Honestly, it is so just because I want to escape from the actual content for a moment — I see the visual improvement as a way to relax my mind during the heavy workloads.  

So I devote much to data visualization, learning through operating. I can use *Tableau* smoothly and several similiar BI tools now. While I drew lots of graphs mainly using Stata, I have already realized that R(gglopt2) and Python(pandas, numpy,...）can do much better or satisfy much more demands. So I keep learning, of course, through operating.   

As a beginner, there is not much evidence to prove my experience with data visualization. Therefore, I have listed no more than three of my works that I can still recall.  

## Data Cockpit / Dashboard
I was appointed to design and realize a dashboard which displays the Development of Common Prosperity in *Yangtze River Delta* recently. Using the data offered by my supervisors, I selected some indicators, made some calculations and designed the layouts and motions of the dashboard. Here I insert a video which was made using a mainstream BI tool in China, *FineVis*, to show what does it look like.

Besides, to import a clean and concise style into my dashboard, I made another one based on the same data source but using *Tableau*.

I also applicated a similiar layout when prepared for the proposal defense of my graduation thesis. These 2 are hardly different.

## Economic Statistics  
I have read somewhere (cannot remember) that graphs speak louder than tables when your model is too giant to show for your readers/audience's first sight. So I generated some images for some of my analysis result, as a reg monkey who prefers colorful blocks than just black&white lines.

I have included some of them here. It should be noted that they are neither my best nor most recent work; they are simply what I could find in my disorganized folders at the moment.  
And I must mentioned that the data has been anonymized and is for demonstration purposes only, without any economic meaning.
