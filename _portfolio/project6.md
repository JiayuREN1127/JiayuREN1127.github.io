Since I don't have so much accomplished works — even if I do, I am just not used to keeping a record — so I intentionally leave this blank grid here, waiting eagerly for more potential and the "yet to come".  

By the way, I regard *[How I Met Your Mother](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/?ref_=tt_ov_srs)* as the best American+Adults sitcom ever (the best American sitcom of all ages is made by Disney, *[Good Luck Charlie](https://shows.disney.com/good-luck-charlie)* ) .
