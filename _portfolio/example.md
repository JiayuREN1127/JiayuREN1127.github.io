Obviously, this website should be a part of my portfolio.  
**I designed, built and tested it mainly on my own, using a template as the reference while being slightly helped by my friend.**  
You can find more details in the "Privacy and THANKS" section.

Domain is purchased at *aliyun* platform.  
Template is from github project [agency-theme](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme), built on *jekyll(ruby)*, *html*, *css*, and *JavaScript*, I made some personalized and customized modifications to it.  
Website is deployed via *Github Pages*, and your visit to the project is welcomed: [JiayuREN1127.github.io](https://github.com/JiayuREN1127/JiayuREN1127.github.io).

My portfolio costs approximately no money but a large amount of time and energy.  
Through the process, I have learnt:
- basic usage of *html* and very little *css*
- the common structure of a website and its project
- how to make full use of *Github*
- stay calm when an error occurs

As a start learner, I kindly ask for your forgiveness and understanding if there are any flaws or mistakes.
