I am already exhausted when writing this part. So just a brief list of titles and abstracts included here. These essays can only be considered undergraduate-level academically, please do forgive me if you regard them as trash.

**Respond to the Public Health Emergencies: The lessons from the two outbreaks of COVID-19 in China  (2023)**  
*COVID-19; Well-being; Major public emergency; Crisis response*  
Using the big data daily indexes from China’s mainstream social media platforms in 2022, this study proposes a general response model of public health emergencies on the core of reducing resident well-being loss. The multi-dimensional impacts of COVID-19 is studied, along with the relevant responses from Chinese government on residents' subjective well-being, which are measured by public sentiment reaction. The analysis reveals that the public health emergencies will reduce the resident well-being by two dimensions, health and economy. Government responses of public medical resource supply and non-medical prevention policies have positive effect on improving resident well-being and reducing the impact of epidemic. As governments face challenges in containing public health emergencies, this study highlights the need to focus on the well-being of residents, understand the impact route of emergencies on well-being, and choose an adequate and equitable policy package with the goal of not leaving out vulnerable targets.

**How Does Internet Usage Affect Loneliness Among Middle-Aged and Elderly Groups? (2023)**  
*Internet usage, Middle-aged and elderly, Loneliness, Social support, Digital divide*  
Currently, China's population development is facing the structural challenge of severe aging. Loneliness among middle-aged and elderly individuals is widespread, posing a prominent social issue that tests the capacity and service level of public policies. This paper utilizes CHARLS data from 2011-2020 to construct a five-wave panel dataset and employs a two-way fixed effects model to identify the mitigating effect of internet usage on loneliness among middle-aged and elderly groups. To address potential endogeneity issues, the study employs: (1) the spherical distance to the nodes of the "8 Vertical and Eight Horizontal" optical cable network as an instrumental variable; (2) propensity score matching; and (3) expanded explanatory variables, for robustness checks. Mechanism analysis based on social support theory reveals that internet usage reduces loneliness by increasing contact frequency with friends and relatives, enhancing social interactions, and diversifying hobby activities. Heterogeneity analysis shows greater subjective benefits observed among non-working individuals, urban residents, middle-to-high-income groups, and those with higher education levels. Future public policies should focus on: improve internet coverage; enhancing digital literacy among middle-aged and elderly groups; promoting "digital reverse mentoring"; transforming "usage" into "utilization"; and narrowing the secondary "digital divide".

**Impacts and mechanisms between inequality, transfers and subjective well-being —— An empirical study based on the comparative perspective (2024)**  
*Inequality; Subjective well-being; Transfer payment*  
Recent years have confirmed the importance of subjective well-being (SWB) in evaluating public policies. Based on a comparative perspective, we discuss the impacts and mechanisms between inequality and SWB, focusing on the role that government transfer can play. Our data source is the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). We find that inequality significantly reduces SWB by affecting public's perception of the opportunity equity and their own economic and social status; the transfer payment helps mitigate the negative effects of inequality by increasing the public's trust in their government and their positive expectations for future, which significantly increases SWB. Moreover, these effects are more pronounced among socially
disadvantaged groups. Our findings are useful in providing perspectives and insights for the formulation and evaluation of redistributive policies.

**The Income Effect of Industrial Parks on Rural Residents from the Perspective of Spatial Distance (2025)**  
*Industrial park; Increase in residents' income; Industry economy; Industrial agglomeration; Non-agricultural employment*   
Currently, the income growth of rural residents is still constrained by factors such as an underdeveloped labor market and the difficulty in obtaining property income. This study matches data from a large-scale household economic survey in Zhejiang Province with spatial location, using the presence of industrial parks as the key explanatory variable while the household income and employment status as the dependent variables. From a spatial and micro perspective, the study measures the positive impact of industrial agglomeration on rural residents' material well-being. Industrial parks significantly increase rural residents' per capita disposable income, wage, and property income by promoting non-agricultural employment and labor mobility. This effect diminishes with geographic distance, with a noticeable spatial threshold at approximately 5 kilometers, beyond which the impact weakens. Additionally, labor in the secondary or agricultural industry, and those who have received a high school education, tend to benefit from the parks more. It is argued that in response to the practical need for improving rural residents' employment and income, narrowing the urban-rural gap, and advancing common prosperity, it is essential to accelerate the construction of industrial parks, optimize their geographical and industrial layout, and further develop the high-level modern industrial economy system. This will contribute to a high-quality economy and continuously enhance the quality of life and well-being of the people.
